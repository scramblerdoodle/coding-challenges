# coding-challenges
Solutions to some coding challenges I've done in the past.

## Usage

To clone and run this project, you'll need `git` and `python` installed on your computer. To run the test suite you'll additionally need the `pytest` python package.

```sh
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/scramblerdoodle/coding-challenges

# Go into the repository
$ cd coding-challenges
```

From which, you can either run the preset inputs for all the questions with
```sh
python main.py
```

Or run the test suite with
```sh
python -m pytest -v .
```

Or run any of the questions individually to use your own inputs with
```sh
python question_{n}.py
```
Where n is the question you'd like to run.
